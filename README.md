# BDO_SkillsBuilder

Abandoned and very bare boned project of around late 2014. Database lost.

First and foremost a pretext to code, it was supposed to be a reproduction of the skills trees in the game Black Desert Online, for the purpose of exploring the different character building possibilities. Planned features were versioning both in terms of languages and game patches, and link generation to share build ideas.
I started the project when the game was still in Closed Beta Test in Korea so populating the database also meant a lot of translation and a good admin dashboard, which I lost motivation to code at the time.
